      <h2>Design Rationale – DormDeals Homepage</h2>

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>The homepage is the first point of interaction between the platform and its users, and it sets the tone for the entire experience. In the case of DormDeals, the objective is to make the purpose of the site clear within seconds — a safe, student-focused space where buying and selling between peers feels natural and trustworthy. The structure, color choices, and placement of elements have all been chosen with this clarity in mind, while also ensuring the interface feels familiar enough that new visitors can navigate it without hesitation.</p>

      <h3>2. Color Scheme</h3>
      <p>The visual foundation of the page relies on a light blue background paired with a bright blue accent. Light blue is a color widely associated with trust, calmness, and openness — qualities essential in any peer-to-peer marketplace, especially one targeted at students who may be engaging in online transactions for the first time. The brighter blue used for interactive elements, such as the “Browse Listings” and “Sell an Item” buttons, creates a deliberate point of focus without being harsh on the eyes. This contrast is important for drawing attention to calls-to-action while maintaining an overall sense of visual harmony. Neutral tones for the text ensure high legibility, while also meeting accessibility standards for color contrast.</p>

      <h3>3. Typography and Messaging</h3>
      <p>The main heading — “Buy & sell stuff with your campus fam” — is set in a large, bold sans-serif typeface. The choice of an informal phrase here is intentional; it immediately positions the platform as friendly and student-oriented, rather than corporate or overly formal. Beneath it, the smaller descriptive line reinforces the core message by naming specific categories (textbooks, furniture, gadgets) and highlighting safety and simplicity as selling points.</p>
      <p>A short advisory line below the buttons acts as a subtle behavioral guide, encouraging users to post quality listings without overwhelming them with instructions at the start.</p>

      <h3>4. Layout and Structure</h3>
      <p>The page follows a two-column structure in its hero section: the left side holds the text and primary actions, while the right side uses a photograph to reinforce the concept visually. This arrangement supports a natural scanning pattern, where most users read left to right, taking in the message before relating it to the accompanying image.</p>
      <p>The design also aligns with the Z-pattern reading flow, leading the eye from the top navigation bar, down to the main call-to-action, across to the image, and then toward the “How it works” section below. Generous spacing between elements keeps the content from feeling cramped, which in turn reduces cognitive load.</p>

      <h3>5. Placement of Elements</h3>
      <p>The navigation bar at the top right follows established web conventions, placing familiar links (“Home,” “Browse,” “Sell,” “About,” “Profile”) where users expect them to be. This reduces the learning curve for first-time visitors. The moon icon for dark mode is positioned nearby so users can easily adjust the interface to their preference.</p>
      <p>The primary buttons (“Browse Listings” and “Sell an Item”) are given prominence just below the headline because these represent the two most important user actions. The order — browsing before selling — reflects the natural progression for most new users.</p>
      <p>The “How it works” section is placed immediately after the hero banner to address questions that might arise in a first-time visitor’s mind, thus helping to overcome hesitation.</p>

      <h3>6. Visual and Interactive Cues</h3>
      <p>Each call-to-action button includes a small icon — a magnifying glass for browsing, a plus sign for selling — which adds an additional layer of meaning. Icons help users recognise actions faster, especially in a student audience where varying levels of English fluency may exist. While subtle, these visual cues enhance the platform’s inclusivity.</p>
      <p>If implemented, hover effects or color changes on buttons act as feedback mechanisms, confirming to users that these are indeed interactive elements.</p>

      <h3>7. Accessibility Considerations</h3>
      <p>The design maintains a high level of text-to-background contrast, ensuring readability even for users with mild visual impairments. The language used is straightforward, avoiding unnecessary jargon, and interactive targets such as buttons are large enough to be easily tapped on mobile devices. These considerations are not just technical requirements but also contribute to making the platform welcoming to a broader audience.</p>

      <h2>Browse Products Page</h2>
      <h3>1. Purpose of the Page</h3>
      <p>The “Browse Products” page is designed to be the functional core of DormDeals, where users actively search for and view listings. Its role is to present items in a way that is visually engaging, easy to scan, and conducive to quick decision-making. This page bridges the gap between curiosity and purchase intent, so clarity and efficiency take precedence in its design.</p>
