      <h2>Philosophy of the Logo</h2>
      <p><strong>Shopping bag icon</strong> → Universally recognized symbol for buying and selling, conveying the idea of an online marketplace.</p>
      <p><strong>Minimalist, black-and-white design</strong> → Suggests simplicity, trustworthiness, and efficiency — no clutter, just good deals.</p>
      <p><strong>Bold typography</strong> → Conveys confidence and stability, reassuring users that this is a reliable platform.</p>
      <p><strong>Name "DormDeals"</strong> → Instantly tells users it's a place for affordable, student-friendly finds, emphasizing community and value.</p>
      <p>Essentially, the logo communicates "smart, convenient shopping for dorm life" — practical yet stylish, aimed at a cost-conscious but modern audience.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2>Problem Catered</h2>
      <p>Across most universities, the exchange of goods between students remains an unstructured, unreliable, and often unsafe process. Whether it's selling second-hand textbooks, passing on hostel furniture, or donating unused electronics, the lack of a dedicated and trusted platform leads to inefficiency, missed opportunities, and unnecessary waste.</p>

      <h3>1. Scattered, Unverified Listings</h3>
      <p>Students currently rely on fragmented channels like WhatsApp groups, Instagram stories, and physical noticeboards to exchange goods. These listings are short-lived, inconsistent in format, and difficult to search through. Buyers waste time scrolling past irrelevant or outdated posts, while sellers fail to connect with the right audience. The lack of standardization also makes it harder to compare options or verify the authenticity of items.</p>

      <h3>2. Safety & Trust Gaps</h3>
      <p>Informal exchanges come with a high risk of scams, misrepresentation, and unsafe meet-up arrangements. Without a central verification mechanism, there is no guarantee that a seller is an actual student or that the product matches its description. Many students hesitate to engage because they fear fraud, personal data misuse, or unsafe interactions during exchanges.</p>

      <h3>3. Accessibility Barriers</h3>
      <p>A significant number of students face barriers due to disabilities or temporary impairments. Most current channels are not designed with accessibility in mind — lacking screen reader compatibility, proper keyboard navigation, or high-contrast modes. This exclusion means some students cannot fully participate in buying, selling, or donating, further widening the gap in campus inclusivity.</p>

      <h3>4. Missed Sustainability Opportunities</h3>
      <p>At the end of each semester, countless usable items are discarded simply because there is no quick, organized way to donate or redistribute them. The absence of a streamlined donation process results in wasted resources, increased landfill waste, and missed opportunities to contribute to campus sustainability goals.</p>

      <p>DormDeals has been specifically designed to tackle these challenges head-on. The platform centralizes all listings into one trusted, campus-specific marketplace with clear categories, powerful search filters, and standardized item cards. Safety is embedded into the core through verified student logins, clear safe-exchange guidelines, and consistent listing formats that reduce misrepresentation. Accessibility is treated as a priority, not an afterthought, with semantic HTML, ARIA labels, skip links, and strong visual contrast built into every page. Finally, the donation flow is designed to be just as simple as selling — encouraging reuse, reducing waste, and aligning with university sustainability initiatives.</p>

      <h2>Design Rationale – DormDeals Homepage</h2>

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>The homepage is the first point of interaction between the platform and its users, and it sets the tone for the entire experience. In the case of DormDeals, the objective is to make the purpose of the site clear within seconds — a safe, student-focused space where buying and selling between peers feels natural and trustworthy. The structure, color choices, and placement of elements have all been chosen with this clarity in mind, while also ensuring the interface feels familiar enough that new visitors can navigate it without hesitation.</p>

      <h3>2. Color Scheme</h3>
      <p>The visual foundation of the page relies on a light blue background paired with a bright blue accent. Light blue is a color widely associated with trust, calmness, and openness — qualities essential in any peer-to-peer marketplace, especially one targeted at students who may be engaging in online transactions for the first time. The brighter blue used for interactive elements, such as the "Browse Listings" and "Sell an Item" buttons, creates a deliberate point of focus without being harsh on the eyes. This contrast is important for drawing attention to calls-to-action while maintaining an overall sense of visual harmony. Neutral tones for the text ensure high legibility, while also meeting accessibility standards for color contrast.</p>

      <h3>3. Typography and Messaging</h3>
      <p>The main heading — "Buy & sell stuff with your campus fam" — is set in a large, bold sans-serif typeface. The choice of an informal phrase here is intentional; it immediately positions the platform as friendly and student-oriented, rather than corporate or overly formal. Beneath it, the smaller descriptive line reinforces the core message by naming specific categories (textbooks, furniture, gadgets) and highlighting safety and simplicity as selling points.</p>
      <p>A short advisory line below the buttons acts as a subtle behavioral guide, encouraging users to post quality listings without overwhelming them with instructions at the start.</p>

      <h3>4. Layout and Structure</h3>
      <p>The page follows a two-column structure in its hero section: the left side holds the text and primary actions, while the right side uses a photograph to reinforce the concept visually. This arrangement supports a natural scanning pattern, where most users read left to right, taking in the message before relating it to the accompanying image.</p>
      <p>The design also aligns with the Z-pattern reading flow, leading the eye from the top navigation bar, down to the main call-to-action, across to the image, and then toward the "How it works" section below. Generous spacing between elements keeps the content from feeling cramped, which in turn reduces cognitive load.</p>

      <h3>5. Placement of Elements</h3>
      <p>The navigation bar at the top right follows established web conventions, placing familiar links ("Home," "Browse," "Sell," "About," "Profile") where users expect them to be. This reduces the learning curve for first-time visitors. The moon icon for dark mode is positioned nearby so users can easily adjust the interface to their preference.</p>
      <p>The primary buttons ("Browse Listings" and "Sell an Item") are given prominence just below the headline because these represent the two most important user actions. The order — browsing before selling — reflects the natural progression for most new users.</p>
      <p>The "How it works" section is placed immediately after the hero banner to address questions that might arise in a first-time visitor's mind, thus helping to overcome hesitation.</p>

      <h3>6. Visual and Interactive Cues</h3>
      <p>Each call-to-action button includes a small icon — a magnifying glass for browsing, a plus sign for selling — which adds an additional layer of meaning. Icons help users recognise actions faster, especially in a student audience where varying levels of English fluency may exist. While subtle, these visual cues enhance the platform's inclusivity.</p>
      <p>If implemented, hover effects or color changes on buttons act as feedback mechanisms, confirming to users that these are indeed interactive elements.</p>

      <h3>7. Accessibility Considerations</h3>
      <p>The design maintains a high level of text-to-background contrast, ensuring readability even for users with mild visual impairments. The language used is straightforward, avoiding unnecessary jargon, and interactive targets such as buttons are large enough to be easily tapped on mobile devices. These considerations are not just technical requirements but also contribute to making the platform welcoming to a broader audience.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2>Browse Products Page</h2>
  <h5>1. Purpose of the Page</h5>
  <p>The "Browse Products" page is designed to be the functional core of DormDeals, where users actively search for and view listings. Its role is to present items in a way that is visually engaging, easy to scan, and conducive to quick decision-making. This page bridges the gap between curiosity and purchase intent, so clarity and efficiency take precedence in its design.</p>
  
  <h5>2. Page Layout and Structure</h5>
  <p>The design follows a single-column header with a grid-based product layout. The search bar is placed directly beneath the page title so it becomes the immediate focal point upon arrival, reducing friction for users who arrive with a specific item in mind.</p>
  <p>Beneath the search input, products are displayed in card format, side by side, allowing for visual variety without overwhelming the page with too many listings in one row. This two-column structure balances density and readability — it allows for more than one item per row without making images too small to be appreciated.</p>
  
  <h5>3. Navigation and Consistency</h5>
  <p>The navigation bar at the top mirrors the one on the homepage, reinforcing consistency and making sure the user never has to re-learn navigation patterns. The persistent placement of "Home," "Browse," "Sell," "About," "Profile," and "Logout" ensures that users can seamlessly move between exploring items and managing their own listings. The dark mode toggle remains visible for accessibility and user comfort.</p>
  
  <h5>4. Search Functionality Design</h5>
  <p>The search bar's large horizontal shape makes it easy to spot and easy to click or tap. Its placement immediately below the page title follows a top-down scanning pattern — users read the heading, understand the context ("Browse Products"), and can instantly begin refining the content. The bright blue search button draws the eye and reinforces the platform's primary accent color, visually linking the search action to the rest of the brand's interactive elements.</p>
  
  <h5>5. Product Card Design</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Image Placement:</strong> The product image occupies the top half of the card, capitalizing on the fact that human attention is drawn to visuals before text. This ensures the first impression of the product is visual, which is essential in an online marketplace where buyers cannot physically examine the item.</li>
    <li><strong>Title and Description:</strong> Titles are short and bold for quick identification, with descriptions in smaller, lighter text below to provide context without cluttering the view.</li>
    <li><strong>Price Display:</strong> Prices are displayed in a distinct line with a currency symbol, giving them high salience so users can evaluate affordability at a glance.</li>
    <li><strong>Call-to-Action ("View Details"):</strong> The button is large, bright blue, and placed at the bottom of each card to naturally follow the user's reading and evaluation flow. This ordering aligns with decision-making psychology — first see the product, then understand it, and finally take action.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h5>6. Visual Hierarchy</h5>
  <p>The visual weight is distributed so that users naturally scan from the top search bar to the first product card and then continue across and down. The white background provides high contrast against images, making colors in the listings pop and drawing attention where it matters most. This also avoids any background distractions, keeping focus on the products.</p>
  
  <h5>7. Accessibility Considerations</h5>
  <p>Product titles and prices are in high-contrast text for readability. Interactive elements such as the search button and "View Details" buttons are large enough to be comfortably clicked on smaller screens. Image dimensions are consistent, aiding users with cognitive processing differences by avoiding irregular visual patterns that could cause distraction.</p>

  <hr>
  
  <h2>Sell / Donate Page</h2>
  <h5>1. Overall Page Layout</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Minimalist, centered form design:</strong> The form is placed at the center of the page to focus the user's attention on the selling/donation process without distractions.</li>
    <li><strong>Generous white space:</strong> The ample spacing between elements prevents visual clutter, making the form appear approachable and less intimidating for first-time users.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>2. Header & Navigation</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>DormDeals logo at top-left — doubles as a home button.</li>
    <li>Navigation bar (Home, Browse, Sell, About, Profile, Logout) — "Sell" highlighted.</li>
    <li>Light/Dark mode toggle — for viewing comfort.</li>
  </ul>
